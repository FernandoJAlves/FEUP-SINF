## Usage

### Build the app
Build the containers:
```
docker-compose build
```

Build the back-end:
```
cd snif-be
npm install
```

Build the front-end:
```
cd snif-fe
npm install
```

### How to run
```
docker-compose up
```
This will create a development server with hot reloading which will listen on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Restarting the backend
The backend often requires restarting with significant changes. To do this, run the following command:
```
docker-compose restart express-app
```
